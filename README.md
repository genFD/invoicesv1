## Overview

### Expected Behaviour

Users should be able to:

- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Save draft invoices and mark invoices as paid by clicking the "Mark as Paid" button. This should change the invoice's status to "paid".
- Toggle light and dark mode

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Users should receive a confirmation modal when trying to delete invoices.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me speed up the styling process. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
